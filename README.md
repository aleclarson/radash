- **What is this?**  
  Radashi, pronounced /raw-dash-ee/, is a modern, zero-dependency JavaScript utility toolkit built with TypeScript for type-safe, readable, and maintainable code. Radashi omits functions that have become obsolete in Lodash and introduces innovative tools for improved error handling, asynchronous operations, and data manipulation. With a focus on readability and maintainability, Radashi ensures that its source code is easy to understand and use, making it simple for developers to copy individual functions directly from GitHub if needed. Radashi is the go-to toolkit for cleaner, more efficient code in today's JavaScript ecosystem.

- **Is this related to Radash?**  
  Yes! This is a fork of the renowned [`radash`](https://github.com/sodiray/radash) library by Ray Epps [@sodiray](https://github.com/sodiray).

- **Why use this over Radash?**  
  This fork aims to be a more consistently maintained version, with bug fixes and improvements. We're open to adding many maintainers to the Radashi team, to keep responsiveness high.

  We are a **community first** fork, which means putting the community's needs first. As such, your feedback is very welcome and we value your perspective. Specifically, we want you to [contribute your viewpoint](https://github.com/orgs/radashi-org/discussions/categories/rfcs?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3ARFCs) to discussions in our RFCs category.

- **Is there official documentation?**  
  Currently, there is no documentation beyond this page. There is work being done, which is tracked by #40. Until then, you can refer to the original `radash` documentation.

- **Are my contributions welcome?**  
  Yes! Pull requests are encouraged, but please keep them small and focused. Sweeping changes are discouraged and won't be merged (unless the rationale's been thoroughly discussed).

  Please review _“The ethos of Radashi”_ before submitting a pull request:

  </a>

- **Can I help you maintain this?**  
  Yes! I'll add you as a contributor to the repository. You can review pull requests and even merge them. You can help with closing issues, too. Committing directly to the main branch is a privilege you can earn, as is publishing versions to NPM.

  </a>

- **Is backwards compatibility a goal?**  
  Yes! We want the transition from `radash` to this library to be smooth. We'll make sure to avoid breaking changes. If any are made, they will be clearly documented at the bottom of this page.

- **Automatic releases**  
  To ensure contributions are quickly rolled out, we have the following automatic processes:

  - **Beta releases**  
    Whenever the `main` branch receives a fix or feature, a beta release is automatically published to NPM.
    Installing `radashi@beta` will always fetch the latest beta release. Beta releases are always audited by the Radashi team.

  - **Preview releases**  
    When the _owner of a PR_ comments `/publish` (and nothing more), the PR is published to NPM under a version like `1.0.0-pr123.f7a9c3b` (i.e. `<latest version>-pr<PR number>.<commit SHA>`) and a tag like `pr123`. This allows the community to use the changes in the PR without waiting for the PR to be merged.

    - ⚠️ **Beware:** Preview releases are not audited by the Radashi team. Always look at their
      changes in the PR to ensure no malicious code was introduced.
