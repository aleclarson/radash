# Contributing to Radashi

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to Radashi!

## You have a question?

If you have a general question about Radashi, how to use it, the roadmap, or an idea to chat about you can ask it on the [discussions](https://github.com/aleclarson/radashi/discussions) page. Before you do, search to see if it's been asked before. If a related topic doesn't exist, you can start a new one.

## You have a problem?

If you have an issue with Radashi, you want to report a bug, or you need an improvement you can create an issue on the [issues](https://github.com/aleclarson/radashi/issues) page. Before you do, search to see if it's already been brought up. If a similar issue doesn't exist, you can create a new one.

## You want to contribute?

Scan through the [existing issues](https://github.com/aleclarson/radashi/issues) to find one that interests you. As a general rule, I donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix. Feel free to ask questions about the implementation or design in a comment on the issue before diving in.

## You want to write code?

- To get started, run `pnpm i` in the project's root directory to install the dependencies.
- You can run the unit tests with `pnpm test`. They require Node v16+. You can run `nvm use` in the root directory to change to the correct Node version. The tests should pass (duh) and maintain 100% code coverage.
- To get familiar with the existing code I would recommend looking through the docs and the codebase in parallel. For each function in the docs, find the implementation in the source and skim over the code.
- When coding, try not to create internal APIs (any function or module that is not exported to be used by the client).
- Also, try not to use functions from other Radashi modules. This is a softer rule but we want to make it easy for readers to understand a function without having to navigate the codebase. As a utility library users should ideally be able to copy/paste a function from Radashi into their project. Most Radashi functions should be easy to write in isolation.
- If an implementation needs more than ~20 lines of code it might be better suited for another package or library. This is another softer rule.

## You're ready to push a change?

Once you've made your changes on a fork of the Radashi repo, create a pull request to the `master` branch of the [radashi](https://github.com/aleclarson/radashi) repository.

- Be sure to fill in a description that lets readers and reviewers understand both the implementation and intent of your changes.
- Don't forget to [link the PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

Once you submit your PR, one of Radashi's maintainers will review it. They might ask questions or request additional information.

## Your PR gets merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: Currently, the package publishing process is manual. Your PR will be updated with a comment when the next release is published. This should happen within 24-48 hours of your PR being merged.
