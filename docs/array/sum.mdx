## Basic usage

Given an array of items, and an optional function to map each item to a number, add up all the items.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 100,
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    weight: 10,
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    weight: 15,
  },
]

_.sum(fish, f => f.weight) // => 125
```
