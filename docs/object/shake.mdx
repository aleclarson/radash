description: Remove unwanted values from an object

## Basic usage

A bit like `_.sift` but for objects. By default, it will return a new object with all the undefined attributes removed. You can pass a second function argument to remove any attributes by a custom condition.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const ra = {
  mode: 'god',
  greek: false,
  limit: undefined,
}

_.shake(ra) // => { mode, greek }
_.shake(ra, a => !a) // => { mode }
```
