## Basic usage

A reduce that handles callback functions that return a promise.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const userIds = [1, 2, 3, 4]

const users = await _.reduce(
  userIds,
  async (acc, userId) => {
    const user = await api.users.find(userId)
    return {
      ...acc,
      [userId]: user,
    }
  },
  {},
)
```
